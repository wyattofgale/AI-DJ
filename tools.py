def search_mp3_files(query: str) -> str:

    Search for MP3 files in the Desktop folder and list them as a playlist in the response.
    Extracts and displays BPM and genre information from ID3 tags when available.
    
    Args:
        query: A string containing search terms and optional commands.
              Format can be flexible:
              - "search: [search terms] | playlist: [playlist name]"
              - "[search terms] | playlist: [playlist name]"
              - Just plain search terms like "Ariana Grande god is a woman"
              
              The search uses loose matching - files will match if they contain any of the
              search words in their filename. Results are sorted by relevance (number of
              matching words).

1. Simple search terms: 'Ariana Grande god is a woman'
2. Formatted search: 'search: Ariana Grande | playlist: My Playlist'
3. Just search with playlist: 'Ariana Grande | playlist: My Playlist'

The search uses loose matching - files will match if they contain any of the search words in their filename. Results are sorted by relevance (number of matching words). The playlist name is used for display purposes only and no physical playlist file is created."""
